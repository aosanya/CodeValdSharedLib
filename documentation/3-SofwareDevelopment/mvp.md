# MVP — CodeValdSharedLib

## Goal

Bootstrap `CodeValdSharedLib` as the single home for infrastructure code shared
across CodeVald microservices, then migrate all confirmed candidates out of
CodeValdCross, CodeValdGit, and CodeValdWork.

---

## Design Principle

> **Put as much as possible in the shared lib.**
> Any infrastructure code used by two or more services — or reasonably expected
> to be needed by a future service — belongs here, not in the individual service.
> Individual services own only their domain logic, domain errors, gRPC handlers,
> and storage schemas.

## Workflow

### Task Management Process
1. Pick tasks by priority (P0 first) and dependency order.
2. Update Status as work progresses: Not Started → In Progress → Done.
3. **Completion** (MANDATORY):
   - Move completed task row to `mvp_done.md`.
   - Strike through the task ID in dependent tasks: `~~SHAREDLIB-XXX~~ ✅`
   - Merge feature branch to main.

### Branch Naming
```bash
git checkout -b feature/SHAREDLIB-XXX_description
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test -v -race ./...
git checkout main && git merge feature/SHAREDLIB-XXX_description --no-ff
git branch -d feature/SHAREDLIB-XXX_description
```

---

## Status Legend
- ✅ **Done** — merged to main (see `mvp_done.md`)
- 🚀 **In Progress** — currently being worked on
- 📋 **Not Started** — ready to begin
- ⏸️ **Blocked** — waiting on a dependency

## P0: Foundation

| Task ID | Title | Status | Depends On | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅ | Go module init | ✅ Done | — | `go mod init github.com/aosanya/CodeValdSharedLib`; add `replace` directives in all consuming services |

---

## P1: Shared Packages

| Task ID | Title | Status | Depends On | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~SHAREDLIB-002~~ ✅ | Shared domain types | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅ | `types/types.go`: `PathBinding`, `RouteInfo`, `ServiceRegistration` — moved from `CodeValdCross/models.go` |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅ | CodeValdCross proto-generated code | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅ | Move `.proto` + `gen/go/codevaldcross/v1/` here; single source of truth for all consumers |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-004~~ ✅ | Generic `registrar` package | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅ | Move from `CodeValdGit/internal/registrar/` + `CodeValdWork/internal/registrar/`; caller injects `serviceName`, topics, routes |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-005~~ ✅ | `serverutil` package | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅ | `NewGRPCServer()`, `RunWithGracefulShutdown()`, `EnvOrDefault()`, `ParseDurationSeconds()`, `ParseDurationString()` |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-006~~ ✅ | `arangoutil` package | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅ | `Connect(ctx, Config) (driver.Database, error)` — bootstrap only; each service keeps its own collection logic |
| SHAREDLIB-012 | Route write classification (`IsWrite` on `RouteInfo` + `RouteDeclaration`) | 📋 Not Started | ~~SHAREDLIB-002~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅ | Service-declared write/read flag per route so Cross's interim Basic-auth gate stops misclassifying POST-search endpoints. Design: [reference/route-write-classification.md](../2-SoftwareDesignAndArchitecture/reference/route-write-classification.md). Spans SharedLib (types + proto + registrar + schemaroutes), Cross (registry + proxy + authMiddleware), Git (annotate every registrar entry). |
| SHAREDLIB-013 | Delete Cross's duplicate `proto/` + `gen/` and import from SharedLib | 📋 Not Started | ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅ | Finishes SHAREDLIB-007, which migrated the Go types but left `CodeValdCross/proto/codevaldcross/` + `CodeValdCross/gen/go/codevaldcross/` intact — they drifted when `IsWrite` was added to SharedLib's proto in SHAREDLIB-012. Repoint the two Cross imports (cmd/main.go, internal/server/server.go) to the SharedLib gen, delete Cross's local proto + gen + buf.yaml + buf.gen.yaml, drop the `proto` target from Cross's Makefile. |

## P2: Consuming Services Migration

| Task ID | Title | Status | Depends On | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~SHAREDLIB-007~~ ✅ | Migrate CodeValdCross | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-002~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅ | Import `types.ServiceRegistration`, `types.RouteInfo`, `types.PathBinding` from SharedLib; remove duplicate definitions from `models.go`; update `go.mod` |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-008~~ ✅ | Migrate CodeValdGit | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-004~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-005~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-006~~ ✅ | Replace `internal/registrar/` with `registrar`; replace `cmd/server/main.go` helpers with `serverutil`; replace ArangoDB bootstrap in `storage/arangodb/` with `arangoutil.Connect`; import Cross gen from SharedLib |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-009~~ ✅ | Migrate CodeValdWork | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-003~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-004~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-005~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-006~~ ✅ | Same scope as ~~SHAREDLIB-008~~ ✅ for CodeValdWork |

## P3: Entity-Graph Infrastructure

| Task ID | Title | Status | Depends On | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~SHAREDLIB-010~~ ✅ | `entitygraph` package | ✅ Done |
| ~~SHAREDLIB-011~~ ✅ | RelationshipDefinition — extend `entitygraph` with typed graph edges, schema versioning, and schema-driven HTTP route generation | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-001~~ ✅ | `entitygraph/entitygraph.go`: `DataManager` + `SchemaManager` interfaces and all associated models (`Entity`, `Relationship`, `CreateEntityRequest`, `UpdateEntityRequest`, `EntityFilter`, `CreateRelationshipRequest`, `RelationshipFilter`, `TraverseGraphRequest`, `TraverseGraphResult`). ArangoDB-backed concrete implementation. Already consumed by CodeValdDT and CodeValdComm (architecturally defined); now being materialised as Go code for CodeValdAgency refactor. **Completed sub-deliverables**: (a) `types.TypeDefinition.EntityIDParam` — type-specific URL placeholder for entity-ID path segment; when empty, per-entity and relationship routes are skipped; (b) `schemaroutes` package — `RoutesFromSchema(schema, basePath, agencyIDParam, grpcService)` generates the full `[]types.RouteInfo` from a Schema, replacing hand-maintained per-type route lists; (c) `registrar.New` now accepts `[]types.RouteInfo` instead of `[]*crossv1.RouteDeclaration` — proto conversion is internal. |
| SHAREDLIB-014 | `EntityFilter` time-range and default ordering for time-series collections | 📋 Not Started | ~~SHAREDLIB-010~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-011~~ ✅ | Extend `entitygraph.EntityFilter` with `TimeRangeFrom *time.Time`, `TimeRangeTo *time.Time`, and `OrderBy string` (default `"properties.timestamp ASC"` when the resolved `TypeDefinition.StorageCollection` is `"dt_telemetry"` or `"dt_events"`). Driver: CodeValdDT FR-004 time-range telemetry queries — `architecture-flows.md §9` and `architecture-storage.md` index list now assume this filter exists. AQL: filter on `properties.timestamp` between bounds; sort on the same field. ArangoDB-backed `DataManager.ListEntities` must honour `OrderBy` and the time bounds when set; both fields are zero-valued by default for callers that don't need them. Also consumed by CodeValdComm if/when it adopts time-bounded message reads. `feature/SHAREDLIB-014_entityfilter_time_range`. |
| SHAREDLIB-017 | `entitygraph/arangodb` correctness fixes — TraverseGraph returns edges + honours filters; soft-delete in GetEntity; private sentinels chained to public ones | 🚀 In Progress | ~~SHAREDLIB-010~~ ✅, ~~SHAREDLIB-011~~ ✅ | Three latent bugs surfaced by CodeValdWork MVP-WORK-016 integration tier. (1) `Backend.TraverseGraph` was returning `Vertices` only — `Edges` were never populated, `req.Names` (label whitelist) was ignored, and `req.AgencyID` was not enforced; rewritten to return both, honour both filters, and reject invalid `Direction` values before AQL substitution. (2) `Backend.GetEntity` did not check `doc.Deleted`, so soft-deleted entities still resolved on read; now treated as not-found alongside cross-agency hits. (3) Private storage-layer sentinels (`errEntityNotFound`, `errEntityAlreadyExists`, `errImmutableType`, `errRelationshipNotFound`) were separate `errors.New` values from the public `entitygraph.Err*` exports — `errors.Is(err, entitygraph.ErrEntityNotFound)` always returned false from the Arango backend, breaking domain-error mapping in every consumer. All four sites now wrap the public sentinels directly (matching the precedent in `schemaops.go`). Branch: `feature/SHAREDLIB-017_traversegraph_returns_edges`. |

## P4: Event Receiver Standard

| Task ID | Title | Status | Depends On | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~SHAREDLIB-018~~ ✅ | `EventReceiverService` proto + `ReceivedEvent` type + `ReceivedEventTypeDefinition(prefix)` helper | ✅ Done | ~~SHAREDLIB-011~~ ✅ | Platform-wide standard for services that consume pub/sub events pushed by Cross. Proto: `proto/codevaldshared/v1/eventreceiver.proto` — single `NotifyEvent` RPC, same path for all consumers. Go: `eventreceiver/eventreceiver.go` — `ReceivedEvent` struct + `ReceivedEventTypeDefinition(servicePrefix)` returning a `types.TypeDefinition` with collection `{prefix}_received_events`. Services call `buf generate` in SharedLib, import the generated stub, and register `EventReceiverServiceServer` on their gRPC server. See [mvp-details/event-receiver.md](mvp-details/event-receiver.md). |

## Success Criteria

- `go build ./...` passes in CodeValdSharedLib, CodeValdCross, CodeValdGit, and CodeValdWork
- `go test -race ./...` all pass in all four modules
- No service contains a local copy of the `registrar` struct, `envOrDefault`, or ArangoDB bootstrap boilerplate
- No service carries its own copy of `gen/go/codevaldcross/v1/`
- `PathBinding`, `RouteInfo`, `ServiceRegistration` are defined exactly once in `CodeValdSharedLib/types/`
- `CodeValdSharedLib` does not import from any CodeVald service
- `entitygraph.DataManager` and `entitygraph.SchemaManager` are defined in SharedLib and importable by CodeValdDT, CodeValdComm, and CodeValdAgency
